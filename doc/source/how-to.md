## ... prepare ancillary data.
For functionality a set of ancillary data (see {ref}`sec-intro-ancillary`) is needed in order to:
 
   * correct measured irradiance due to alignment of the instrument (ship movement)
   * estimate trace-gas absorption and Rayleigh-scattering optical depths in order to calculate the aerosol optical depth
